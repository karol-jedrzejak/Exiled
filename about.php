                Exiled was founded in Poznań in 2015. The band was founded by Karol (Guitar and vocals) and Marmur (Bass)
                who previously played together in the band Spinecrusher. After a long search for a drummer, this position
                was taken by Gogul.</div>

                <div class="about-text"><div class="about-year-nr">2016</div><br>
                In 2016, this line-up recorded the first material entitled "Spiral Of Madness". In the
                meantime, the band was looking for a bass player. Shortly after recording the album, a music video for the
                song "Nuclear Holocaust" was shot, and soon after Tomek joined the bass player and Marmur switched to the
                second guitar.</div>

                In 2017, they managed to release their debut album on CD in the limit of 50 hand-numbered
                copies. In May 2017, Exiled played their first concert at the Elyzjum club together with Tassack and Szaga.
                In 2017, they managed to play a concert in Bydgoszcz and again in Poznań.</div>

                The year 2018 began with a change
                in the line-up - Bassist Tomek was replaced by Michał. In March, Exiled played a concert in Poznań, and in
                the summer they managed to play at the Naturalnie Mazury festival in Węgorzewo. The band was constantly
                creating new material, however, in 2018 Michał and Marmur decided to leave the band. It ceased operations
                at the end of the year.</div>
